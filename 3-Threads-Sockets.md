### Deadlock

what is `deadlock` ? (scenario) How to avoid it?

Situation in which no progress is being made  E.g. The workers are both waiting for each other to release their tools.  
Prevent deadlock by breaking one of the coffman conditions: 
Mutual Exclusion  (No more than one thread can be in the critical region(area of code that accesses the shared resources) at once)  Circular Wait  Resource Holding  No preemption(Threads canâ€™t interrupt each other)  
---
what is a `finally` used in networking?
The finally block of code executes before a program terminates. This prevents connections from staying open if the program crashes.

This directory contains several examples involving threads:

01-sleep-and-work  
   slave threads that simulate work by sleeping for random times,
   running in parallel. Illustrates nondeterminism of concurrent programs.

02-racing-counter  
   slave threads sharing a counter object without any synchronization.  
   they "race" to access the counter, interfering with each other.  
   the results are unpredictable.

03-lock-counter  
   shared counter object that is accessed with synchroniztion (locking) in
   the threads. No interference occurs.

04-sync-counter  
   shared counter object whose methods are synchronized.  
   behaves correctly without interference.

05-sync-lock-counter  
   an experiment to see what happens if the methods of counter use separate
   locks instead of a single lock.

06-eating-deadlock  
   two shared objects being locked in opposite order, causes cyclic wait.
   this is called "deadlock" because the program gets stuck without making
   progress.

DiningPhilosophers/deadlocking  
   A more complicated version of cyclic wait.  
   Even though all philosophers lock their objects in the same order,
   deadlock still happens

DiningPhilosophers/good  
   We avoid deadlock here by making one philosopher lock the objects in the
   opposite order.  
   But this can cause the "starvation" problem, a philosopher not being able
   to eat enough because the other philosophers keep using the forks
   alternately.
